    <h2>How do I login?</h2>
    <p>Visit your shop url, press 'login' and enter your email address.
       You will receive an email with a link which logs you into your shop.
       We don't store passwords at Subscribie, so you're more safe from
       password theft.</p>

    <h2>What is my shop url?</h2>
    <p>Your shop url is in your welcome email. It is comprised of your business
       name entered during sign-up.</p>

    <h2>Is it possible to have both a recurring price and a one-off price on the same product?</h2>
    <p>
     Yes. Although this is a rare scenario, in this scenario, you would create the same item twice but with two titles:<br />
     Title one: (Your product name) - Pay one-off <br />
     Title two: (Your product name) - Pay monthly<br />
      You would then configure only an up-front cost for item one, and 
      a monthly fee for item two. Easy!
    </p>

    <h2>May I use my own web address/domain name?</h2>
    <p>Yes, after activating your shop you can either use an existing web address you 
       own, or purchase an additional domain through us. We recommend 
       <a href="https://domains.karmacomputing.co.uk" target="_blank">Karma Domains</a> 
       for .co.uk subscription websites. You don't have to do this, all shops get a 
       Subscribie branded web address for free!
