    <h2>Present Multiple Plans</h2>
    <p>
    Simply enter the different plans / packages you want to offer and
    their individual pricing. You can set a monthly cost, and an optional 
    upfront fee. Typically you'd create two or three plans, but you're 
    free to add an <em>unlimited</em> number of packages if you wish.
    </p>
    <p>
    The pricing options are flexible, for example, you may wish to just sell 
    an item 'one-off' (such as a trial). In this case, simply set the package 
    with no monthly cost, and just an upfront fee. 
    <p>

    <h2>Got a website already? You can embed Subscribie into it</h2>
    <p>You can embed Subscribie into an existing website. We provide a piece
       code which you simply paste into your website. Just login your shops 
       admin dashboard, copy &amp; paste the code and you're done!

    <h2>Order notes</h2>
    <p>
    When you create a subscription website, you can request the customer 
    (optionally) leaves you a message. This is useful for customisation, 
    or if you simply need more information from the customer before starting
    their subscription. On your administation dashboard you can view order
    notes, and the email address of the customer who made the order.
    </p>

    <p>
    It's now possible for customers to leave you a simple
    note when they start their subscription.</p>
 
    <p>
    Upon editing your subscription shop items, simply check the box "Require note from customer",
    and customers will have the option to specify a message during the order process.
    </p>

    <p>Once complete, on your admin dashboard, you can view the most recent order notes 
       against the customers email address.

    <h2>Manage one-off and subscription payments</h2>
    <p>Subscription payments are handled by Direct Debit using GoCardless, and upfront
    payments are handled by Stripe. This gives you a lot of control over your 
    subscription website, as you can vary the styles of payment you wish to offer.<p>

    <p>You can mix and match, for example have a package which has a simple monthly cost,
    or, add an upfront cost to it (for example an administration fee). Subscribie will only
    ask customers for the information you need; if you're only selling on subscription, 
    with no upfront cost, Subscribie will skip that step. Making the checkout as fast
    as possible means more people will complete the checkout experience.</p>

    <h2>Integrated online chat</h2>
    <p>
    Chat live with your existing and potential customer, with the <em>free</em>
    embeded live chat service. We integrate with the popular "Tawk" live chat
    widget so you can stay in touch with customers easily and quickly.
    </p>

    <h2>Style and customise your shop</h2>
    <p>
    	With a little CSS know how, you can change the colours and style of
	your subscription website. This is really useful if you're wanting to embed your 
	subscription website into an existing site, or if you have brand
	colours you want to stick to. 
    </p>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>
    	From your subscription website dashboard, under modules click 'Style 
	Shop'. From here your able to insert custom style rules to change
	the existing colours. You'll need to know a little CSS for this, and it's super easy!

    </p>

    <h2>Free Shop address</h2>
    <p>
	Every shop gets a free shop web address, so if you don't have a web address
	already, you can use ours for free. If you have an existing website address, 
	you can either embed Subscribie into your existing website, or ask for 
	help to connect your existing address to Subscribie.
